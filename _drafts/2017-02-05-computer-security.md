# Attack vectors

- Brute force
- Password gets leaked
- Device gets stolen
- Device or transaction gets compromised


# Protection strategies

## 2-factor authentication (2FA)

> **Enable 2-factor authentication whenever possible. 2FA is a must-have for accounts that are related to identity, personal data or finances.**

- Primary email address
- Accounts on twitter, instagram, facebook, google+, …
- Bank account
- Cloud storage


## Passwords

> **Always use ultra-strong passwords. Never reuse one for multiple services. Never type in a password on a device that is not yours.**


## Files

> **Never load files or apps, unless you trust both the creator of it and the source of distribution.**

- Configure mail account that it doesn’t load attachments automatically.


## Encryption and access control

> **Encrypt all physical devices and always activate access control mechanisms.**


## Networks

> **Never connect to untrusted networks. Never exchange meaningful data via unsecure communication channels.**


## Recovery

> **Backup all critical data regularly. Keep recovery keys available in a safe place.**
