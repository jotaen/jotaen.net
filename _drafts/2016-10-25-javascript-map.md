A few weeks ago I published a blogpost in which I presented a [functional code kata in Javascript](/L2hWc/the-discount-campaign) and how I solved it with build-in functional methods.

In this blogpost, I want to compare three implementations of `map`:

- [Native JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)
- [lodash](https://lodash.com/docs/#map)
- [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/docs/#map)

## What is map?

## Signature

## Functors

## Flexibility
