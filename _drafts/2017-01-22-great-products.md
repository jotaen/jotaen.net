Perhaps it’s just a coincidence, but when I talk to other web developers about the tools they use and the workflows they have, I noticed that a majority agree on a basic set of products nowadays: Trello, Slack, Confluence, Github.

I asked myself whether there are any patterns why some of these tools are so successful while others never make it to the market. And I’m not talking about business strategies, but just about how the product is designed and what it offers.

Back in the day I worked in a place where we introduced a project management tool for a software project that we were working on. I remember how my manager was excited about having a place where everything comes together: We could file bugs and issues, we could keep track of roadmap and overall progress, and the platform even integrated with mail and git. I was convinced by all the potential benefits. The enthusiasm for the tool disappeared the first time I went to the dashboard. I was completely lost and overwhelmed, I didn’t even see a starting point.

# The Open/Closed Principle

- Expert tools (people who know the domain)
- Example: Slack
    + Doesn’t impose a process on you, but suggests workflows by offering useful features
    + Open/Closed: It’s core idea is clear and stable. But it’s open for being extended and flavoured.

# Breathe of expertise

- Why do people go to specialized retailers instead of buying on the internet? Because of expertise
- Example: Namecheap

# Fast, simple and straightforward

- Low registration/onboarding hurdle, let users start right away
- Lets you pick up where you left off
- Example: Trello

# Respect

- Don’t sign up users for your newsletters
