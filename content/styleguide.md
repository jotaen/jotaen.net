This is a meta post that specifies the layout and design elements of my website. It is written in the style of a blog post and therefore also serves as a visual example for one.

# Typography

The [“input“ font face](http://input.fontbureau.com) has a technical look goes nicely with this blog, whose topics cover coding and technology mainly. The fact that it comes with a whole bunch of different styles is a strong advantage, since typography is the most important stylistic device on text-heavy sites.

# Logo

While I don’t want to appear as a brand, I still want to create a visual identity that is supposed to be somewhat unique and recognisable. Therefore I use a logo along with my name, however, without a custom font. The logo is reminiscent of an icon for a person or user without looking generic though.

Its backstory of the logo is that I used my nickname “jotaen” as logo back in the day, set in the [“Jan LT” typeface](https://www.linotype.com/60646/jan-regular-product.html):

The first two letters “jo” rotated by 90° yield my logo. (Credits go to my former coworker [Charisse](https://dribbble.com/charisseysabel) for that idea!)

# Colours

There are a few predefined colours that can be used to give semantic meaning to certain elements like links, tags or buttons.

<style type="text/css">
    .colortile { display: inline-block; width: 5em; height: 3em; margin: 0.25em; }
</style>
<div class="colortile" style="background-color:var(--color-green)"></div>
<div class="colortile" style="background-color:var(--color-blue)"></div>
<div class="colortile" style="background-color:var(--color-lightblue)"></div>
<div class="colortile" style="background-color:var(--color-red)"></div>
<div class="colortile" style="background-color:var(--color-purple)"></div>
<div class="colortile" style="background-color:var(--color-orange)"></div>
<div class="colortile" style="background-color:var(--color-brown)"></div>

# Text

## Running text

A Paragraph is a block of running text. It is supposed to be between a couple and around a dozen of lines of text. The line-length is up to 80 characters at most, for optimal legibility. The space between two subsequent paragraphs is around 1½ times the line height.

In order to highlight a passage, text can be **bold to indicate strong emphasis** or it can be *italic (or: obligue) for light emphasis*. The italic style has a slightly thiner font-weight to stick out a bit more. <span class="link">Weblinks</span> come in blue and underlined; <span class="link-visited">visited websites</span> are colored purple. (Unfortunately, the latter has come a bit out of fashion, but I consider it to be a very important feature – isn’t the web all about links?) `There is inline code`, which is `monospaced` on a `light grey background`. There is enough spacing so that two code pieces in subsequent lines don’t collide. All text selection is in the same colour as the header bar. Try it out!

## Headlines

H1 is a break to divide the text into multiple chapters: it is rather thin in font weight, but it is generously surrounded by whitespace to make it sufficiently prominent. H2 is a sub-division within a chapter (with some extra whitespace), wheres H3 is associated with its subsequent paragraph (with no extra whitespace). Other headline levels are not in use.

### H3 headline
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt[^1] ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

## Definitory lists

#### Some term:
This is a definition of “some term”.
#### Another term:
This is another definition. As you can see, the explanation text can also be longer, which means that the text floats around the definition
#### One last item:
And here is yet another item. It’s the last one, however.

# Block elements

These are block elements, which are supported by markdown.

## Blockquote

> The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.[^4]
