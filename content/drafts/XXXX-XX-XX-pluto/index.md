I recently got my teeth into the history of the exploration of Pluto, which I found utterly fascinating. That not only for the obviously magnificent engineering achievements that were carried out all along the way, but also for some interesting implications that got me thinking as a software developer.

The image above shows a photo composition of the New Horizons space probe during its flyby maneuver of the Pluto system. It consist of the actual photographs as they were made by New Horizons in 2015. These pictures with their level of detail are an extraordinary revelation whose historic significance can only be fully understood in the context of the string of research efforts that reach back into the 19th century.

The extend of a blog post is of course not nearly enough to comprehensively summarise this long lasting and entangled history of how Pluto was discovered and explored. Hence, my article only reflects a small, subjective portion of it. (And, unlike the title might suggest, most of it has actually nothing to do with software development in the first place.)

## The discovery of Pluto

Pluto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in January 1930. This wasn’t by mere chance though, it rather was the result of a long series of preceding endeavours from numerous people. The existence of a trans-Neptunian planet had been speculated about for decades already, since the observed positions of Neptune and Uranus didn’t exactly match up with their mathematically predicted ones. That led to the anticipation of another, more outward planet whose gravitational influence was assumed to account for their deviated trajectories. The configuration of such an object was not just uncertain though, but the theory as a whole was debated controversially – and, in fact, eventually proven false about a century later. (We’ll come back to that later.) Nevertheless, at that time it was the main driving force for a man named Percival Lowell to start an extensive research project.

Lowell was a descendant of a wealthy business family from Boston and had an educational background in mathematics. After years of travelling the Far East in the late 19th century he fully dedicated himself to astronomy and founded his own observatory in Flagstiff, Arizona in 1894. One of his primary areas of interest were the surface structures of Mars, mainly canals and craters, which he believed were created by intelligent forms of life as some kind of sophisticated water supplies. Lowell published three books on that matter, and while his works fueled the public excitement about the possibility of life on Mars, scepticism in the scientific community continued to grow to a degree that damaged his reputation.

Convinced by the hypothesis of a trans-Neptunian object, Lowell initiated a systematic search in 1906 for what he would call “Planet X” – the inferred but yet unknown planet. His own efforts yielded no success though and he died in 1916 without having accomplished his mission. As an ironic twist of fate it would turn out later that Pluto was actually captured on one of Lowell’s photographs, however, he didn’t recognise it: on the basis of his calculations he was looking out for a brighter object of much bigger size.

In hindsight it would be easy to belittle Lowell’s beliefs and achievements, but considering the state of knowledge and technology at that time his tenacity and pioneering spirit was nothing short of admirable. Lowell’s death was followed by turbulent times at the observatory, which put the search for “Planet X” to a halt for more than a decade until it was eventually resumed in 1929. A new photographic telescope had just been acquired for that purpose and 23-year-old Clyde Tombaugh was hired to operate it. Tombaugh was a self-started astronomer, who grew up as the son of farmers in the Midwestern United States. Without having received any advanced scientific training up to that point, he managed to build his own telescope at his parents house, which allowed him to draw remarkably detailed pictures of Mars and Jupiter. He sent those to the Lowell Observatory in Flagstiff, who – impressed by their accuracy – invited Tombaugh to work there. “An opportunity of a lifetime”, as he would recall later on, that indeed marked the beginning of a fruitful scientific career.

In the following months Tombaugh systematically photographed the night sky through the observatory’s telescope and analysed the pictures by means of a so-called blink comparator. This device would project two images on a screen and flip back and forth between them in rapid succession. By carefully superimposing photographs that were taken a few days apart from each other, Tombaugh eventually was able to spot a faint white dot that appeared in different positions over time – he had discovered Pluto! Its name was proposed shortly thereafter by an 11-year-old girl from England and then taken on unanimously by the observatory’s staff: Pluto, the God of the Underworld in Greek mythology, seemed not just to be a fitting metaphor, but its first two letters also happened to match Percival Lowell’s initials.

## Putting things into perspective

With a diameter of 2374 kilometers, Pluto is slightly smaller than Earth’s Moon. It orbits at the outer edge of our Solar System in the Kuiper belt, which is so far out that reflected sunlight travels multiple hours before it reaches Earth. Geometrically speaking, the observation of Pluto can be compared to trying to inspect a classical painting over the distance from San Francisco to New York City. Considering this, it is rather unsurprising that the gain of knowledge after the initial discovery in 1930 was anything but swift: it was a matter of decades to narrow down Pluto’s exact dimensions, to learn about its primary surface materials and to improve the image quality from a faint tiny dot to a small blurry blob.

![Pluto and it’s moons Charon, Styx, Hydra and Nix]()

The probably most groundbreaking news in a long time came about in 1978 with the discovery of Pluto’s satellite Charon. Subsequent investigations would show that it is of such substantial proportions that the barycenter of both objects (i.e. the common center point that they both orbit around) is located between them, outside either body. This effect is faintly reminiscent of a pair spin in ice skating, where both partners hold onto each other while they rotate around the same axis. As for the name, Charon was the boatman in the Greek mythology, who ferried the deads over to the Underworld.

Another pivotal realisation was the disproof of the “Planet X” theory as a whole, which over time became more and more evident. For one, as a relatively small and remote object, Pluto does not have enough gravitational impact on Neptune and Uranus to tug them off course. And beyond that, the physical properties of Neptune had to be revised due to the measurements conducted by the Voyager 2 space probe in the late 1980s, which ultimately rendered the hypothesis of a compensatory mass obsolete. While this implicates that the discovery of Pluto was virtually a coincidence, it also opened the door to a whole new world, a massive circumstellar disc beyond Neptune: the Kuiper belt.

The idea of an outer asteroid belt had already been hypothesised since the 1930s, so its official discovery in 1992 was long in coming. From then on, more than a thousand Kuiper belt objects (KBO) have been found and their estimated total number goes into the hundred thousands – it manifested itself that Pluto is only one entity among countless others. The ensuing reclassification as dwarf planet in 2006 encountered some fierce resistance, both in the scientific community and in the public. It wasn’t the outgrowth of mere quibbling though, it rather must be seen as consequence of a landmark paradigm shift: the comprehension that the Kuiper belt is a vast structure, which we have been largely unaware of, but that nonetheless is essential to our understanding of the Solar System. And hence it is marginal to complain about the need to correct school books regarding the number of planets, when there are actually entire chapters yet to be written.

## Setting off to new horizons

The preparation of a space mission to Pluto happened to evolve roughly along the same timeline as the exploration of the Kuiper belt. The voices that lobbied for such an undertaking started to raise in the late 1980s, at about the same time when the Voyager 2 mission was in its final stages. A flyby of a space probe was expected to be a literal eye-opener, therefore scientists and engineers outlined and discussed multiple suchlike scenarios.

In 2003, after one and a half decades of intense scientific and political battle, NASA finally started to construct a space probe that beared the name “New Horizons”. The team was led by Alan Stern, an experienced NASA investigator who had already been spearheading an informal group in 1989 that called themselves “Pluto Underground”. Apart from the inspection of the Pluto system, the probe was also supposed to traverse the Kuiper belt in the subsequent years.

New Horizons was deployed into space from Cape Canaveral in January 2006 and sent off for a nine year long journey, pacing at 50,000 km/h into the void. It carried an array of scientific instruments, but the payload also contained an ounce of Clyde Tombaugh’s ash.
