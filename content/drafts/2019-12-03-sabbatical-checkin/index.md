After having worked as a software developer professionally for the last six years, I resigned 8 months ago to take a sabbatical. My main motivation was to take time off for doing self-study, but I also wanted to prepare myself to working freelance in the future. At the time of this writing, both are still ongoing topics. In this blog post I want to share the story with you how this all came to be and where in this adventure I am at the moment.

# My backstory

Allow me to tell you a little bit about my professional background. I have been interested in computers since my early teenage years. I built some smaller websites here and there and did a little coding on the side just for the fun of it. The outcomes of that weren’t particularly bad, but I still don’t count it towards my profession experience. It was basically just a hobby, nothing that I was extraordinarily passionate about.

After graduating from school I studied mechanical engineering, mostly because I was interested in technology and applied sciences, which I was both genuinely eager to dive deeper into. During university my interests slightly shifted though and I happened to slip into an engineering project, in which I – more or less by chance – took over the software development part in the construction of a prototypical research apparatus. Working myself into that was a tough challenge, but driven by curiosity I wanted to get a glimpse behind the curtain of what professional software development looked like in the industry. The learning curve was steep and I enjoyed it so much that I continued to work for that company as a programmer. Later on I switched fields to the web, because I found that to be more compelling in regards to work processes and business applications.

Without having a degree in computer science it wasn’t easy to start off a career in the first place. I knew that I am a strong learner and that getting up to speed was only a matter of time, once I got a foot in the door somewhere. Due to the lack of relevant experience though I needed to find other ways to prove that I can provide value within a company: first off, I realised how important it is to gain a solid understanding of where the value of a particular business lies and to figure out how to effectively contribute to that. And secondly, that a company is an inherently social environment, where collaborative and communicational skills are profoundly important to making a successful impact.

My technical skillset is self-acquired for the most part. I worked hard for that and dedicated a decent amount of spare time throughout the years to build up my knowledge and develop my competences. I was never satisfied with “just coding”, I rather aspired to understand how things work deep down and how they relate to each other. That way, I gradually established a conception of quality, developed a sense of what good craft looks like, and learned to reason about it with increasing confidence.

Today, I declare myself as being a professional software developer. This doesn’t mean I’m perfect, omniscient or that I know all the dodges. (Quite the contrary!) What it means is that I routinely take on ownership and responsibility for the work I am doing. I have a proven track record of solving problems and being productive, which I regularly received appreciative feedback about. I am well aware of what I am capable of and what not. I know what it needs to create useful and reliable software that profitable businesses can be built around. And yet, I always felt that I was missing something.

# The sabbatical

> [anectdote about solving problem but lacking fundamental knowledge]: having worked with languages etc. but not knowing how parsers/compilers work (AST, machine instructions, etc.)

Needless to say that I suffered from the imposter syndrome countless times.

> acquire in university are solid foundational groundworks

> Typical work day: […]

> I have a second job as instructor for rock climbing, mountaineering and outdoor education

> There is another topic that coincides: I never felt entirely comfortable in the classical fulltime work setup. Even though I always enjoyed working in a stable team on a continuous product, I couldn’t really settle myself down for the hustling treadmill of a 40h workweek with a precisely numbered amount of vacation days per year. I want to use this break as an opportunity to try out different work models for me, which is why I’m about to start working freelance.

## Making ends meet

Let’s talk money. The idea of doing a sabbatical is intriguing and not a single person who I talked to wasn’t excited about it themselves. There is, however, a flipside: the bills must be paid. Apart from some little extra income from my second job, I lived off savings for the last 8 months, mostly to pay for rent, insurances, food, and the countless miscellaneous things like internet service, gym membership or public transportation.

When my sabbatical started I often felt stressed because I virtually heard the clock ticking. Not having regular income means burning down savings, which the bank statements soberly prove in cold print at the end of every month. There is no illusion that I need to start making money again at some point and I could sense that hanging above my head like the sword of Damocles. Over time my perspective fundamentally shifted. Today I don’t perceive my sabbatical as “burning” money, I rather think of it as an investment into myself. I’m not quibbling here, I really do mean it like that. This sabbatical gives me the chance to develop myself professionally in a way that wouldn’t have been possible alongside a fulltime job. (I have tried that – it didn’t work out for me.) Whether or not it will also pay off financially is not important to me, it’s solely about what I learn that determines the return-of-investment.

One thing that proved to be extremely helpful in preparation for this year was the fact that I maintain a thorough spreadsheet of all my regular spendings. This allows me to forecast how long I can autonomously live off a specific amount of money. Setting up such an overview needs to be done carefully and was a tedious exercise, but it rewarded me with precious confidence. In the end, it turned out to be accurate by more than 95%. Another vital factor for me is being very deliberate about my expenses. I’m not radically frugal – I still go to concerts, buy sustainable food and do occasional (short distance) travels – but I uncompromisingly cut down on everything that I don’t feel provides enough value to me.

Some people told me that they envy my guts to just quit and do my own thing. But I have to say, it doesn’t feel overly brave to me. Instead, I attribute a great deal to external factors that I have little influence on. Given the current job market for software developers, there couldn’t be better (read: less risky) times for such an undertaking. I’m not at all worried about not being able to get back into the job market. I don’t have relatives that are financially dependent on me. I don’t need to pay off student loans. I was born into a safe and economically stable country, in which I have no less than all chances to shape my life however I want to. This year made me realise more than ever before how incredibly grateful I am to be given these invaluable priveledges.
