  <p>
    My name is Jan. I live in Berlin and work as software developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    My primary driver is to create great software products that are meaningful for the people who use them. I’m a passionate coder and tinkerer at heart, and I genuinely enjoy to work on the entire software stack from the bare metal all the way up to the user interface. My professional focus lies on the architectural and social aspects that facilitate agile product development on the basis of sustainable technological foundations. I like clear and deliberate designs – be it systems, code or layout – and am a typography enthusiast alongside.

    Besides work, I love climbing in the mountains, travelling around on my motorbike or playing the piano. On the background picture, you see me on top of the summit needle of Salbitschijen in Switzerland.
