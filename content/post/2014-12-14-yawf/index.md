I was always seeking for a tiny framework to develop tiny websites (like this blog is). Basically, website frameworks are a dime a dozen: Apart from big players like Symfony or CakePHP, there are thousands of these lightweight projects all over Github. However, it was not only the agony of choice, which made me hesitate – especially in terms of the smaller projects, I found them often to be quite specialized or too badly documented to get started as an “outsider”.

As a consequence, I started to develop my own one: [I named it YAWF and I published it on Github](https://github.com/jotaen/yawf) just this moment. It is still in an early stage of development (public alpha), but I scheduled a first stable release for spring 2015. Since I wrote a bit of documentation for it, I don’t want to make too much words about the project at this place and would like to refer you to the Github repository.

By the way: I also changed my blog over and implemented it with YAWF. This turned out to be pretty fun and I think the project is well on the way. I will update this article within in the next weeks and report about my experience. If you have any ideas or thoughts concerning YAWF, feel free to [get in touch unaskedly](/about).

## YAWF in a hundred words

> YAWF is “Yet Another Website Framework”, which is tailored for small website projects. It is trading upon constraints rather than taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut, thereby offering you a maximum of freedom in structure and design. Basically, YAWF is better to be described as an environment than a framework: It performs the dispatch and the initialization of components, but doesn’t impose any particular design patterns on you. The whole process flow is easily traceable and therefore convenient to work with. YAWF comes with a thoroughly modular structure, that boosts productivity and allows you to write and reuse generic components.
