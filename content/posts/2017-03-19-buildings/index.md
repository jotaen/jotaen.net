Growing software is the same thing as developing a building. The most interesting thing about buildings is not their initial concept but how it evolved and adapted over time.

One of the biggest mistake in architecture is to focus exlucisvely on the overall look or other outward facing attributes. But building a house is nothing that you finish – it is something that you start. The same holds true for software: just releasing a feature that meets the initial requirements is not sufficient for sustaining a business in the long term. Both technical and market environments are always evolving, and features must constantly adjust to suit the unfolding patterns of their usage.

But how can we deal with this inherently volatile situation? It is hardly possible to forsee every upcoming trend and we should generally strive for staying flexible. The ability for change is a critical premise for what we call agile software development nowadays. However, certain decisions must be made in the early stages and cannot be deferred. It is wasteful to forearm for all imaginable alterations, but it is critical to be aware 

## Shearing layers

- **Site**: The geographical setting where the building is located.
- **Structure**: Foundation and load-bearing elements
- **Skin**: The facade and other exterior surfaces and elements
- **Services**: Wiring, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, elevators
- **Space plan**: 
- **Stuff**:

When considering buildings, the layers of change are concrete and tangible, because a house is made of physical material. Changing the site would mean to relocate the entire house from one spot to another, and the enormous amount of work is apparent. But unlike buildings, software is not made of physical material. Its main building block is source code that is poured into patterns and assembled to abstractions, eventually forming the basic structure that the application consists of. This makes the costs of change much harder to judge.
