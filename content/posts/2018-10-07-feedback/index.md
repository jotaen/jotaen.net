A lot of advice can be found on what good feedback looks like and how to give it to others, and despite, most people do it much too little or – worse – they hardly give feedback at all. The reason for that is certainly not lack of opinions or utter apathy. Apart from the effort that it needs to come up with good feedback, giving it also entails risks that require courage and confidence to overcome: Will I manage to bring my point across? Am I even right with what I’m saying? How will the other person react when they hear it? Will they be upset and start an argument? Or will they think of me as an arrogant smartypants? These and a hundreds of other concerns are usually bothering someone when they consider to give feedback.

You are probably well familiar with the situation where a co-worker speaks about someone else behind their back in a brutally honest way. Maybe you have  wondered then why your colleague doesn’t simply go to that other person to sort out the issue with them directly, instead of blowing off their steam at you. While this is a whole other question in itself, what you should really ask yourself here is how often the very same scenario occurrs – but the other way around. Do you have a clue how often *you* are the subject of complaints, discontent and annoyance that never reach your ears? The number of times someone else thinks *you* better could have done something differently, but they won’t ever share it with you?

... Giving feedback is hard, but receiving it is a skill as well.

The matter of feedback is primarily *how* we do something: the way we treated a friend the other day in a stressful situation; the method that we used to explain a complex topic in a presentation at work; or how we reacted when we were confronted with an uncomfortable decision. Feedback is never an objective assessment though, but it’s based on personal perception. No matter how hard you would try to phrase it genericly, the feedback that you give will always reflect your very own interpretation and eventually reveal something about yourself. And herein lies a strong reason why you might feel uneasy about giving feedback: it exposes some of your feelings and that makes you vulnerable.

# Dealing with feedback

The “art of receiving feedback” basically consists of three maxims: listen, appreciate and consider. (And as simple as that sounds, as difficult it can be to put into practice.)

### Listen
First an foremost, receiving feedback is all about listening – and that in the most sober way possible. Don’t object, don’t explain, don’t justify, don’t concede. Just listen. Your hackles might raise because of how outrageously wrong the feedback appears to you. Perhaps you discovered that it was all just a misunderstanding. Or you notice that the other person was obviously just missing some crucial bit of information. Maybe hearing the feedback and not responding makes you feel uneasy. But: regardless of what actually happened (in your opinion!), neither can you change the run of events nor can you influence how these events were perceived and interpreted by someone else. Keep in mind that feedback is only about that. To understand the effect that your behaviour and acting had on someone else. Not more, not less.

### Appreciate
The most appropriate reaction when receiving feedback is to show appreciation for the fact that it is given to you. A common misconception here is to confuse this with the approval of its content. It is no contradiction to show sincere gratitude for the feedback itself on the hand, but to innerly dissent on the other without any indication whatsoever. In fact, being able to distinguish both carefully is what requires most confidence and maturity.

Thorough listening is the biggest contributing factor in order to make the other person feel valued and respected. You hereby show serious interest and give room to them for developing and sharing *their* thoughts with you. Put yourself in the other person’s shoes and remember what inner hurdles had to be overcome to eventually open up to you. Defending yourself or openly dismissing the feedback would not just be egocentric, it also has the potential to immediately destroy all trust irrecoverably. Once someone else would have learned that you don’t accept what they feel, they might never again be truly honest with you.

### Consider
- Think of feedback as going to a market.
- It is then up to yourself to evaluate what you do about this feedback, whether you want learn something from it or not.
- Maybe follow up (apologise, correct)

# The mechanisms of feedback

You cannot realistically expect other people to give feedback to you proactively. Most of the time, you will have to ask for it. The success of this depends on a lot of different aspects and it is important to understand the prerequisites that facilitate honest feedback.

- **Trust** – Probably the strongest factor, albeit the most difficult one at the same time.
- **Superiority** – 
- **Anonymity** –
