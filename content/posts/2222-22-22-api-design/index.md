Great API design = Sweet spot between the following attributes:

- Correct:
    - Make illegal states unrepresentable
    - Allow for fine-granular failure
- Comprehensible:
    - Meaningful and understandable mental models
    - Abstractions that make sense in and of itself
- Convenient:
    - Convenience in the sense of “ergonomics”
    - Account for standard use cases
    - Descriptive naming
