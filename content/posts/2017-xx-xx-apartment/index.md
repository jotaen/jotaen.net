# Approaching the search

## Where to look?

## Necessary documents

- **Selbstauskunft**: This is a basic questionnaire about you. Filling it out is voluntary, but of course it’s highly unlikely to get an offer without doing so.
- **Mietschuldenfreiheitsbescheinigung**: Yes, that’s one word. This is an (informal) document from your previous landlord affirming that you always paid your rent on time and don’t have any outstanding bills.
- **Schufa Auskunft**: The Schufa GmbH is a company that maintains a credit rating for every private person who holds a German bank account. You can obtain a document from them that provides information about your solvency and creditworthiness.
- **Last 3 payrolls** The payrolls are a proof of income. It’s also okay to copy the relevant pages from your working contract, if you have a new job and didn’t receive any pay slips yet.

## Communication

## Bribing

A colleague asked me the other day whether it helps to offer the landlord money in order to increase chances. I don’t have any experience with this, but bribing is an uncommon thing in Germany and usually considered criminal. I guess that it will rather raise suspicions instead of making anything better.

# Law of tenancy

In Germany there are special laws and rules that govern the apartment market. Therefore rental contracts are usually standard and just a few parameters are up for individual agreement.

## Minimum rental period

The statutory notice period for terminating a rental contract is 3 months. However, the landlord can preclude this right for the first time in order to prevent overly frequent fluctuation. This is called “Mindestmietdauer” or “Kündigungsverzicht” and can last up to 4 years. Only after this term has expired the tenant is allowed to cancel the contract. (From then on with regular notice period.)

Some people underestimate the severity of this clause. Consider the following scenarios and the entailing consequences:

- You loose your job and cannot afford to pay the rent anymore
- You are expecting a child and need to find a bigger place
- You receive the job offer of your life, but you would need to relocate

In all of these cases you wouldn’t be legally permitted to cancel the contract early. It would be completely up to the goodwill of the landlord: in the worst case, there is no way out. Of course you could try to sublet your apartment for the remaining period, but you are still solely responsible for everything what’s happening inside.

Personally, I accept a minimum rental period of one year, but I wouldn’t go higher than that. Just do the maths: If the apartment is EUR 700 a month with a minimum time of 4 years, you would owe EUR 33,600 as of the moment you sign the contract.

## Stepped or indexed rent

Once the rental contract is signed the rent is fixed. It can only be increased afterwards when the landlord provides a really strong reason, like extensive modernisation works on the building.

# Bridging the first time

Finding a good place can take several weeks or months. Even if you have all your documents and are always the first one who gets in touch, it still remains a numbers game. A landlord told me once that she literally rolled the dices.

### Sublease

A lot of apartment owners sublease their places when they are out of town. You find their offers on [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com) or [wg-gesucht.de](http://www.wg-gesucht.de/).
