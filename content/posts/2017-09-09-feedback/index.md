## What is feedback anyway?

The matter of feedback is behaviour. More specifically: by giving feedback to another person you express how you perceived her behaviour and what impact it made on you or other people that have been involved. Feedback is not an objective assertion, it rather reflects your very own observations and feelings. This is not only important to understand as a feedback giver, but also as a receiver. Feedback cannot be properly understood without knowing about the role of the person who gives it and your relation to her.

## It’s not what you say, but how you say it

## Find the right scope

## Praise isn’t feedback

## Support your assertions with evidence


# Summary

1. The matter of feedback is behaviour: split that rigorously from factual discussions.
2. Feedback solely expresses your personal view: make sure to reflect that in your language.
3. Find the right balance: communicate the broad picture for reference, but make it concrete enough to be helpful.
