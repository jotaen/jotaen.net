## Keep everyone in the loop

- Inform about risks proactively

## Verify that your changes are successful

- Keep an eye on logs and monitoring

## Baby steps, not seven-league boots

- Small increments that are continuously released
- Feature/dev flags

## Always think forward, but mind the retreat

- Two-pronged data migrations
