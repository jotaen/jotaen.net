In school, at work or in our private lifes – almost everywhere we are reliant on getting feedback from our peers, colleagues and friends in order to learn how to get better at what we do. But despite its importance, we often shy away from giving good feedback ourselves. We either do it much too little or we wrap it up in cotton to be sure no feelings will possibly be scratched. The reason for our reluctance is certainly not lack of opinions or utter apathy. Apart from the effort that it needs to come up with good feedback, delivering it also entails risks that require courage and confidence to overcome: Will I manage to bring my point across? Am I even right with what I’m saying? How will the other person react when they hear it? Will they be upset and start an argument? Or will they think of me as an arrogant smartypants? These and a hundred of other concerns are usually bothering us when we consider to approach someone with feedback.

You are probably well familiar with the situation where, say, a co-worker speaks about someone else behind their back in a brutally honest way. Maybe you have wondered why your colleague doesn’t simply go to that other person to sort out the issue with them directly, instead of blowing off their steam at you. While this is a whole other topic in itself, what you should really ask yourself here is how often the very same scenario occurrs – but the other way around. Do you have a clue how often *you* are the subject of complaints, discontent and annoyance that never reach your ears? The number of times someone else thinks *you* could have done something differently, but they won’t ever share it with you?

# What is feedback?

To state that “giving feedback is hard” is only one side of the coin. Receiving feedback is an equally difficult skill and your ability to master it is directly proportional to the amount and quality of feedback that you will receive. But before we dive into that, we should clarify what feedback is to begin with.

The matter of feedback is primarily *how* we do something: the way we treated a friend the other day in a stressful situation; the method that we used to explain a complex topic in a presentation at work; or how we reacted when we were confronted with an uncomfortable decision. Feedback is never an objective assessment though, but it’s fundamentally based on personal perception. In brief: feedback tells us what effect our behaviour and acting had on someone else.

No matter how hard we would try to phrase it genericly, the feedback that we give will always reflect our very own interpretation and eventually reveal something about ourselves. And herein lies a strong reason why we often feel uneasy about giving it to others: it exposes our feelings and makes us vulnerable. Keep this in mind by all means! In fact, this realisation is crucial for our own behaviour as recipient of feedback.

# How to deal with feedback

The “art of receiving feedback” is a skill that basically consists of three maxims: listen, appreciate and consider. (And as simple as that sounds, as difficult it can be to put into practice.)

### Listen
First an foremost, receiving feedback is all about listening – and that in the most sober way possible. Don’t object, don’t explain, don’t justify, don’t concede. Just listen. Your hackles might raise because of how outrageously wrong the feedback might sound to you. Or perhaps you come to the conclusion that everything was just an awfully unfortunate misunderstanding. Maybe you notice that the other person was obviously just missing some pivotal piece of information, and only this made them feel that way. But: regardless of what actually happened (in your opinion!), neither can you change the run of events in hindsight, nor can you influence how these events were perceived and interpreted by someone else. Remember that feedback is all and only about that. The protagonist of a feedback conversation is not you, it is the person who gives it.

### Appreciate
The appropriate reaction when receiving feedback is to show appreciation for the fact that it is given to you. A common misconception here is to confuse this with the approval of its content. However, it is no contradiction to show sincere gratitude for the feedback itself on the hand, but to innerly dissent on the other without any indication about this whatsoever. In fact, being able to tell both things apart carefully is a hard-earned virtue that testifies a high level of personal maturity.

Thorough and candid listening is the biggest contributing factor to signal appreciation. By actively giving room to the other person to develop and share *their* view, you make them feel trusted and respected. Put yourself in the other person’s shoes and remember what inner hurdles they had to overcome to open up to you. This is a valuable (and probably rare) occasion, so you are well-advised to make it as pleasant as possible.

On the other side, however, defending yourself or even directly dismissing the feedback would not just be egocentric, it also has the potential to destroy your trust and credit in a hardly recoverable way. Once someone has learned that you are unable to accept their own thoughts and feelings, they might button up and never again be open and honest with you.

### Consider
Processing feedback can be compared to buying clothes in a shopping mall. There are different things offered in various designs, colours and prices – some of which you like better, some of which you like less. In the end, it is entirely up to you what you buy; whether you want to try out a new style or whether you stick to the old one. Whether you take something as-is or whether you have it adjusted to your needs. Whether you go on your own or whether you ask a friend to come along for advice. Point being is: you decide what you get out of the feedback (or not) and you can (and should) take your time for that.

While you don’t need to give account to anyone, it is very well possible to follow up on feedback if you think that it is needful. For instance, you could apologise when you realise that you hurt someone’s feelings. Or you could take action when you came to the conclusion that a certain improvement would help to prevent something similar from happening again. In this case you should make sure to let the other person know, so that they can see the positive changes which their feedback had led to.

# Contributing factors

You cannot realistically expect other people to give feedback to you proactively. Most of the time, you will have to ask for it. The success of that depends on a lot of different aspects and therefore it is important to understand the prerequisites which facilitate honest feedback.

- **Trust** – This is the strongest enabler, albeit the most delicate one at the same time. Trust usually builds up naturally as relationships deepen over time and people learn that they can rely on each other. Eventually they feel respected and protected even when sharing uncomfortable or confrontative thoughts. Personal affection (or good “chemistry”) between two people is often a vital building block for a trustful relationship.
- **Superiority** – This means that there is some sort of hierarchy in which the feedback giver is higher up than the receiver. The hierarchy can be set in roles explicitly, e.g. as manager and employee, but it can also stem from a gradient in age or experience. The relation between these two parties makes giving “downward” feedback easier because it usually coincides with certain behavioural expectations that such a hierarchy implicates.
- **Anonymity** – Comment sections on popular news websites are the best example that prove how anonymity correlates with frank (but sometimes also blatant) honesty. This effect can be utilised for the collection of feedback, especially when there is otherwise no trustful basis that would allow people to share their thoughts openly.
