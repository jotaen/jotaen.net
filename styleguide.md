The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright. He’d be damned if any slopes gonna put their greasy yellow hands on his boy’s birthright, so he hid it, in the one place he knew he could hide something: his ass.

Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid this uncomfortable piece of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you.

###### Ezekiel 25:17

> The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.

- Now… I been sayin’ that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, that meant your ass. You’d be dead right now. I never gave much thought to what it meant. I just thought it was a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker before I popped a cap in his ass.
- But I saw some shit this mornin’ made me think twice. See, now I’m thinking: maybe it means you’re the evil man.
  - And I’m the righteous man.
  - And Mr. 9mm here…
  - He’s the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness.
- Or it could mean you’re the righteous man and I’m the shepherd and it’s the world that’s evil and selfish. And I’d like that. But that shit ain’t the truth. The truth is you’re the weak. And I’m the tyranny of evil men. But I’m tryin’, Ringo. I’m tryin’ real hard to be the shepherd.

Mmmm! Goddamn, Jimmie! This is some serious gourmet shit! Usually, me and Vince would be happy with some freeze-dried [Taster's Choice](//google.com) right, but he springs this serious GOURMET shit on us! What flavor is this?

### Headline 4

I don't need you to tell me how **fucking good my coffee is, okay?** I'm the one who buys it. I know how good it is. When Bonnie goes shopping *she buys SHIT*. I buy the gourmet expensive stuff because when I drink it *I want to taste it*. But you know what's on my mind right now? It AIN'T the coffee in my kitchen, it's the dead nigger in my garage.

### Headline 5

No, No, No, No, let me ask you a question. When you came pulling in here, did you notice a sign out in front of my house that said `Dead Nigger Storage`?
